## An overview of c, c++, and c#
c is the precursor to a bunch of languages and is essentially the Latin of the programming world. c is the precursor to c++. In other words, c++ is c but with a lot more features. This also means that c code is generally compatible with c++ compilers but not necessarily the other way around. c program files have the ```.c``` file extension while c++ program files have the ```.cpp``` file extension. c# is a completely different language made by Microsoft that doesn't get used very often.
