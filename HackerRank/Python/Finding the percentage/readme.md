# Solution
Not that hard, just had to finagle with some obscure (at least to me) formatting syntax that I haven't touched in years.

Xenonminer also made a solution to this as well.

**EDIT**: I just realized that I wrote my own input code when they already had it in the problem. Well, I'm leaving my first iteration of code to teach my future self to read instructions properly.
