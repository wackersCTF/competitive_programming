## An overview of C, C++, and C#
c is the precursor to a bunch of languages and is essentially the Latin of the programming world. c is the precursor to C++. In other words, C++ is C but with a lot more features. This also means that C code is generally compatible with C++ compilers but not necessarily the other way around. C program files have the ```.c``` file extension while c++ program files have the ```.cpp``` file extension. c# is a completely different language made by Microsoft that doesn't get used very often.
